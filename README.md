GettingAndCleaningData
======================

Peer Assessment exercise for the Getting and Cleaning Data course from Coursera. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used in this exercise represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, and it is hosted in the UCI Machine Learning repository, under the name "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set".

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Instructions
============

You should download and unzip the following file:

Move the unzipped data to a working R directory, or change the working R directory to the place where you unzipped the data. When you are done, please execute the "run_analysis.R" script, that goes through the following steps: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final results are written in the file "tidy_dataset.txt".
